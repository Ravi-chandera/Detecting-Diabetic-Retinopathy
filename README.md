# Detecting-Diabetic-Retinopathy
# **Problem Statement**

Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is one of the leading causes of vision loss among individuals with diabetes. Manual screening processes are time-consuming, resource-intensive, and often unavailable in underserved or rural areas. There is a need for a scalable, efficient, and reliable solution to detect DR early and consistently.

# **Expected Outcomes**

- A functional AI model that can identify signs of Diabetic Retinopathy from retinal scans.
- Demonstrated improvement in detection speed and consistency compared to manual screening.
- Reduced dependency on specialist availability through assistive diagnostics.
- Deployment potential in remote areas through mobile or edge devices.
- A step towards large-scale screening for DR, contributing to early intervention and treatment.
