# Dataset Idea & Preparation
## More about DR

Diabetic retinopathy is an eye condition and a complication of diabetes that damages the blood vessels in the retina—the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye responsible for vision. It is a leading cause of vision loss and blindness in adults, particularly in people who have had diabetes for many years

### Causes

- Diabetic retinopathy is caused by prolonged high blood sugar levels associated with diabetes
- Over time, high blood sugar damages the tiny blood vessels in the retina, causing them to leak fluid or bleed
- In response to this damage, the eye may grow new, abnormal blood vessels that are fragile and prone to bleeding, leading to further vision problems

### Types and Stages

There are two main stages:

- Non proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (NPDR): The early stage, where blood vessels in the retina weaken, swell, and may leak fluid or blood. This can lead to swelling of the retina (macular edema) and mild vision loss
- Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (PDR): The advanced stage, marked by the growth of new, abnormal blood vessels on the retina’s surface. These vessels can bleed into the eye, cause scar tissue, and may result in severe vision loss or blindness

### Symptoms

- Early diabetic retinopathy often has no symptoms
- As the disease progresses, symptoms may include:
    - Blurred or fluctuating vision
    - Dark or empty areas in your vision
    - Spots or floaters
    - Vision loss

### Risk Factors

- Anyone with type 1 or type 2 diabetes is at risk
- The risk increases with the duration of diabetes, poor blood sugar control, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, pregnancy, and smoking

### Complications

- If left untreated, diabetic retinopathy can lead to serious complications such as:
    - Vitreous hemorrhage (bleeding into the gel that fills the eye)
    - Retinal detachment
    - Glaucoma
    - Permanent blindness

### Prevention and Management

- Good control of blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol can significantly reduce the risk and slow the progression of diabetic retinopathy
- Regular eye exams are crucial for early detection and treatment
- Treatments include laser therapy, anti-VEGF injections, and surgery in advanced cases

## Human observation of images

I believe if we can see some samples for each class, we get more idea of how they differ from each other, so later on during misclassifications we might know that what went wrong. 

Take a look at 100 images of each class.
